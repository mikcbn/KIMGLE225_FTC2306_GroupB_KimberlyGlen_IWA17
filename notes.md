1. Fixing createArray Function: (Line 23)

    const createArray = (length) => {
        const result = []

        for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            result.push(i)
        }

        return result
    }

* The issue in the original code was that the loop was not correctly initialized. I added let i = 0 (Line 26) to initialize the loop variable properly.

* The purpose of this function is to create an array of numbers representing the days of the week (0-6, Sunday to Saturday) to be used later in the code.

2. Fixing createData Function: (Line 33-61)

- The original code had issues with correctly determining the start day of the month and the calculation of dayOfWeek. The following was adjusted: 

* 'current.setDate(1)' (Line 35) sets the date to the 1st day of the current month.

* 'startDay' (Line 37) is calculated using 'current.getDay()' to get the day of the week (0-6) for the 1st day.

* The loop for 'dayIndex' (Line 49) is now correctly initialized with 'let dayIndex = 0.'

* 'dayOfWeek' (Line 54) is changed to start from 0 (Sunday) to match JavaScript's date object.

* Proper logic is added to calculate 'day' (Line 50) based on the start day and the current week.

* 'isValid' (Line 51) is used to determine if the day falls within the current month.

3. Fixing createHtml Function (Line 74):

* In this function, I added logic to determine whether a cell is today, a weekend, or part of an alternate week. 

* Appropriate CSS classes are added to classString based on these conditions.

* The 'classString' (Line 86) is used to apply the correct styling to each cell in the calendar.
